     <h1> Mickey Mouse </h1> 
     <p Mickey Mouse is an American cartoon character co-created in 1928 by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks. The longtime icon and mascot of The Walt Disney Company, Mickey is an anthropomorphic mouse who typically wears red shorts, large yellow shoes, and white gloves. Inspired by such silent film personalities as Charlie Chaplin and Douglas Fairbanks, Mickey is traditionally characterized as a sympathetic underdog who gets by on pluck and ingenuity in the face of challenges bigger than himself.[2] The character’s depiction as a small mouse is personified through his diminutive stature and falsetto voice, the latter of which was originally provided by Disney. Mickey is one of the world's most recognizable and universally acclaimed fictional characters of all time.></p>

    <h2> Shin-chan is his relatives' endearing nickname for him. He is five years old and like Chocobi chocolate biscuits and the TV superhero Action Mask, but he despises green peppers. Himawari, his sister, is always in his thoughts. His mother gave him more genes than his father. He is lazy, loves to eat and sleep, stingy, stubborn, imagining things, cannot resist excellent things, opinionated and brazen, just like his mother, with the exception of liking to watch and flirt with lovely young females.

        Shinchan is talkative and observant. He has little to no sense of shame. He is seen doing drag or wearing animal costumes on various occasions in both manga and anime. His antics have solved the concerns of others around him countless times. He also has a surprising talent for modifying the wording of songs he performs. On rare times, he exhibits altruistic kindness.</h2>
